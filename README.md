Gomodest is an demo app inspired from modest approaches to building webapps as enlisted in https://modestjs.works/.

It can be used as a template to spin off simple Go webapps. The webapp is mostly plain old javascript, html, css but with spots of SvelteJS used for interactivity without page reloads.

Used:

1. Go, html/template
2. SvelteJS
3. StimulusJS
4. Bulma CSS

```bash
$ cd web && yarn install && yarn watch
$ go run main.go
```
